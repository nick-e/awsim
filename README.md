# AWSIM - A Web Server Built In C++

Awsim (**A** **W**eb **S**erver **I** **M**ade) is a web server built using C++. It's not completed yet, but the goal is to run the program as a daemon that can handle HTTP requests both statically and dynamically and support HTTPS and HTTP 2.0. A major requirement is for it to be scalable and fast.
